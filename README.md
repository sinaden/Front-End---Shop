# Front-End---Shop
An E-shop interface with only 6 items in it. 

The Shop is not fully completed some changes need to be done in the Shopping cart.

(It's working but selected Items would be deleted after refreshing the page. I tried to use local storage by the way but it is not a quite proper tool for this kind of task and we need a real back end programming for that. But as the fucos was in Front end I decided to leave that backend part.)

I used local Storage in order to put the picture of items in the view.html page when the user clicks on view button of each item. 
In the view page we need a little desctiption of the so called item apart from its picture. So the local storage is also used in that part.

The ability of editing is not working in my eshop that's because it really requires a backend. The backend is not an issue for me but I wanted to send the shop before it is too late.
